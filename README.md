## TODO: 
 - Add a timer for each player. Customizable time limits.
 - Better AI logic for non-capturing moves. And better overall strategy.
 - Fix King movement logic (currently making illegal moves)
 - Improve the game over menu
 - Reset pieces captured UI after calling newGame() (function to do this?)

 - Fix the number captured text position so it doesnt go off the width of the screen 
 - When selecting your own piece, instead of displaying "illegal move", say "{pieceType} deselected"

 - Keep highlighted piece highlighted when its selected
 - If your in check, say it when trying to illegally move a piece
 - Fix AI to not repeat moves

DONE?
 - Tie game over screen when its actually checkmate
